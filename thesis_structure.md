## Introduction

### What is genetics and how it relates to disease

* What is DNA? How does it relate to proteins?
    * How does our body use these proteins for daily function?
    > Papers on protein regulation
    > Papers on central dogma?
* Why do some diseases have a genetic basis?
    * How can we predict prognosis given DNA seqeunce?
    * Provide example of cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs etc.
    > Cite respective papers on cystic fibrosis, Tayâ€“Sachs disease
* How can we analyze the genome?
    > Papers on seqeuncing technology review

### What is a GWAS

* Why are most diseases not monogenetic?
    * Where are theses SNPs typically located
    > Papers on monogentic diseases
    > Papers on how most diseases are not monogenetic/provide example of a disease (e.g MS, Cancers, T2 Diabities)
* How does GWAS look at genotype?
    * why are we not sure which gene each mutation effects
    > papers on GWAS review
    > GWAS on various diseases

### Finding association between SNP and Disease

* Which SNP in the GWAS is the causitive one?
    * Descibe the profile of SNPs in a locus
    * Why is the profile like this?
    > maybe paper about LD
* How do we find causality of GWAS results?
    * What considerations/assumptions do we need to make
    > paper on GWAS

### What are eQTLs

* How do eQTLs work?
    * what information do they need, what is their output
    > Review on eQTLs
    > Paper on recent eQTLs
* What are the differences between cis/trans-eQTLs
    * Why is it hard to find trans-eQTLs?
    * Why can't we just do a bunch of pairwise comparisons?
    > Trans-eQTL review papers

### Chromosome Chromosome Conformations

* How do other parts of the choromosome regulate proteins millions of base-pairs away?
    * How does this tie into trans-eQTLs
    > papers on trans-regulators of genes
* How can we find these chromosome chromosome interactions?
    * what assays are commonly used?
    > 4C and Hi-C papers here
* How can we integrate Hi-C/4C data to help us find trans-eQTLs?
