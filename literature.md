## eQTL Papers

- [x] [Revealing the architecture of gene regulation: the promise of eQTL studies, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168952508001777?via%3Dihub)
  - Review paper on eQTLs in general. What they are, how they work, limitations and strengths. General information about the difficulties of finding distal eQTLs, and the typical trends seen between cis/trans. 

- [ ] [eQTL studies: from bulk tissues to single cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1673852723001133)
  - A more up to date reveiw on eQTLs with additions of single cell RNA-seq

### Trans

- [ ] [Systematic identification of trans eQTLs as putative drivers of known disease associations](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2756)
  - Large scale study finding trans eQTLs

- [ ] [Large-scale cis- and trans-eQTL analyses identify thousands of genetic loci and polygenic scores that regulate blood gene expression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00913-z)
  - Exmaples of how they found a lot of Trans-eQTLs

- [x] [Matrix eQTL: Ultra fast eQTL analysis via large matrix operations](https://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/)
  - R package to work with eQTLs, fast, and doesn't get slowed down with co-variets. Tests each SNP with linear model (Sum least squares) or ANOVA. Presents a genotype across all samples as a row in a matrix. Presents all gene expressions per gene as a row and samples as columns so it can do matrix multiplication.

## 4C

- [ ] [Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) uncovers extensive networks of epigenetically regulated intra- and interchromosomal interactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1891)
  - Main 4C paper

## Hi-C

- [ ] [Hi-C: A comprehensive technique to capture the conformation of genomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1046202312001168?via%3Dihub)
  - Main Hi-C paper, describes the methods of the assay as well as the output
