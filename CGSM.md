## Outline

### Background within the context of current knowledge in the field
* Human genome is 
* GWAS shows associations between genetic variation and disease
  * Typically screens for thousands of 
* We don't know mechansism of these SNPs 
   * They are typically in gene regulatory regions or regions of open chromatin, which means they likely regulate gene expression
* eQTL analysis can statisically find if a SNP change leads to a transcriptional change
  * There are two types of eQTLs, cis- (typically within 1mB from transcription start site) and trans- (longer)
  * These transcriptional changes can provide insight into disease etiology and subsequently, therapeutic opportunities
* Most previous research forcused on cis, which accounts for 1/3-1/2 of the GWAS results
  * Trans-eQTLs, underpowered, cell types, and context (environment), may help explain the rest
  * > Where is the paper for this ratio?
* Given the focus on cis-eQTLs, and the given importance of finding them, there is an unmet need of both finding methods and searching for trans-eQTLs
  * Trans-eQTLs present with two main issues, smaller effect size and difficult to account for multiple test correction (assuming you're testing every point of the genome to a gene of interest)
  * Finding new methods can increase the yield of GWASes, and thus, increase the effecitively of a widely used methodology
* Chromosome conforation assays can show how chromosomes interact
  * Gives guidance to streamline where to search, easing multiple test correction

### Objectives and Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: trans-eQTLs can be found through incorporating data from chromosome confromation assays.

1. Use data from chromosome conformation assays to determine which parts of the genomes are worth testing
2. Incorporate data into GWAS and RNA-seqs to find trans-eQTLs in autoimmune diseases
3. Develop pipeline?
